# CrudeWord

## Origin of this project

This project was finished within 30 minutes due to my urgent need yesterday in preparing for today's English exam. Thus, there must be tons of bugs in it.

I wanted a simple, ads-free software that allows user to customize the word list freely. At the same time, I hope it can provide accurate description of those vocabulary. Additionally, a scientific learning curve should be applied in its operating process, so that user can memorize new words quickly.

Unfortunately, I didn't find any software supporting those three requirements above. So I wrote one. It is a **CRUDE** software, I admit, but, it support everything I was in search of yesterday. So that's it.
